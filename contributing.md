# Contributing to ElectronSimpleStarter
I welcome contributions large and small, and I'm happy to help new developers gets started working on public code. You can go ahead and make contributions whether it's:
- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
If you have a feature idea or discover a bug, please open an issue so we can discuss it before you spend too much time trying to implement a solution. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally 
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a PR in our repository 

I want to give contributors as much credit as reasonably possible, so I may provide you feedback on your pull request instead of just merging and fixing the issues myself. That's meant to be helpful, but if it gets frustrating please let me know and I'll try to find another way to move it forward.

If you have code the addresses an issue, please make a reference to the issue in a comment on your pull request so it is easy to see the connections. If you just want to refactor some code that is messier than it should be just go ahead and open a pull request when you're ready.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/acrosman/ElectronSimpleStarter/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Bug Report

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code (if you can)
- Expected Behaviour
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
